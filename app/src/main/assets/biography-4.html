    He had to leave his maternal uncleâ€™s home and moved
    to a slum
    at Ultadanga along
    with his mother and brother. At this time he was
    solely dependent
    on the meagre wages of
    his brother.

    His first poem <em>Yama</em>was published in Kabita, a
    literary
    magazine
    published by Buddhadeb Bose. He started writing for
    Krittibas and other magazines.
    Buddhadeb Bose also invited him to join
    the Comparative Literature
    course in newly opened
    Jadavpur University. He
    joined the course, but could not complete it
    either.
