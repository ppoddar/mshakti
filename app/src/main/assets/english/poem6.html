Seen postmen in the Forest of Fall
Their yellow bags like bovine belly
Picked letters of past, old and new
Those postmen in the Forest of Fall
  

Seen them ceaseless
Like egrets fish
Mysterious, alert, agile
Not like postmen of our times
Not like hands that lose letters of our luxurious love

We are drifting apart
Going afar for lure of letters
Getting more letters from far
Going away from you yesterday
To post love letters today
Thus we drift away from our kin
Reveal our foolish weakness and greed

We no more see us in mirror
We float away in loneliness of our balcony
We are floating away bare in moonshine
Long haven't held each other in arms
Long haven't kissed each other
Long haven't heard other sing
Long haven't seen a carefree kid
We are walking towards a forest older than the woods
Where the eternal leaves left their marks on the rocks
We are heading to a world void of contact

Seen many postmen in the Forest of Fall
Their yellow bags like bovine belly
Filled with old letters anew
Those postmen in the Forest of Fall
  
A letter drifts apart from a letter
Never seen a tree drifting from a tree.
