Still have your favorite key
One that was lost?
How do you now open the vault?

Still got that spot on your chin?
Sudden urge to write
Before journey
Begins to a new land

Kept the key with all the care
For all the years
"Do you want it back?
Please let me know."

Your luminous face
Awash with tears
In memories' attic
"Do you want it back?
Please let me know."
