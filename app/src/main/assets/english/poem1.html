Wilted frame in the room
Unlike that twilight of monsoon
Rainsoaked flowers in the garden
Melodies of Joy.

The boy comes no more to the green
The banyan weeps no more on his flute
Still lightning sparks
'midst the thunderclouds

Hadn't she known
Moments like this
Grabs the rooster's comb?
Hadn't she known
Waste of heart
Is never to be?

Hadn't she known
This gift of gab
Not as deep as my heart?
Hadn't she known
No one knew her
As much as me?

Wilted frame in the room
Unlike that twilight of monsoon
Rainsoaked flowers in the garden
Melodies of Joy.
