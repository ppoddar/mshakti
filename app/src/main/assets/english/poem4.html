Deep commotion ashore
"Whose corpse floats on the river?
Where was his home?"
Night waves only ramble:
"It's I, the anarchist".

Does ocean embrace living and the dead
Both so dear?

Who knows if hemlock is the right drink,
Elixir is poison?
Intellect wilts day and night.

Deep commotion ashore
"Whose corpse floats on the river?
Where was his home?"
Night waves only ramble:
"It's I, the anarchist".
